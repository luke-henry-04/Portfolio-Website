                    A custom MBR bootloader written in x86 assembly that loads a kernel file into memory from disk, sets up a Global Descriptor Table, and switches the CPU into 32-bit protected mode before transferring control.
                    This is part of an independent study into low-level development using Intel's x86 Software Developer's Manual as a primary reference. Current work focuses on developing a minimimal operating system that can run and schedule programs.

                    An integrator for the above pathtracer enabling a smoke simulation with volumetric rendering. It uses a semi-Lagrangian, grid-based method to approximate and discretize the Navier-Stokes equations for incompressible fluids with constant viscosity. Advanced techniques include a Conjugate Gradient pressure solver, monotonic cubic interpolation, and the Henyey-Greenstein phase function for realistic light scattering.

                   A system to measure and display propeller RPM for UCSD's Human Powered Submarine Club. A Hall effect sensor reads the magnetic field from a rotating cuff around the propeller shaft, sending it to an arduino which calculates the RPM and displays it on the pilot's LCD screen. The sensor is attached via a 3D printed mount, with multiple design iterations to fit within limited space constraints and facilitate installation in hard-to-reach spots.
                   <p> A custom scheduler divides CPU resources between the sub's different sensors to ensure accurate RPM readings, preempting with a best estimate when other sensors have been waiting for new readings.

                    I wrote scripts that take data from a 3D model in Blender and generate an SVG image of the model's triangles with numbered vertices. A laser cutter can use the SVG file to cut out and engrave thin triangles that can be assembled into a physical, to-scale sculpture of the original 3D model. I used it to laser cut a 3D model out of plywood, which I assembled together as the frame of a project for my sculpture studio.
