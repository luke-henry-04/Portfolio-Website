                I designed this website using HTML and CSS, hosted via Github Pages. 
                The website hosts my Computer Science and Visual Arts portfolios, 
                and is responsive to different screen resolutions and orientations. 
                It makes use of CSS transforms and viewport-percentage coordinates to 
                position and size decorative text within the background images.

                I started a low level development project in my spare time to
                learn more about how computers function. Using Intel's x86 software 
                development manual (SDM) as a reference, the project began with writing 
                16-bit real mode programs directly in the MBR partition on a hard drive.  
                Initial programs involved writing text to the screen from keyboard input 
                and coloring the pixels in VGA graphics mode. 
                I then created a simple "bootloader" program that loads 
                larger files from the rest of the drive into memory and runs them. 
                Future plans for the project involve creating a proper bootloader 
                that also switches the CPU into protected mode and transfers control to an OS. 
                I also intend to develop a simple OS for the sake of understanding drivers, 
                memory paging, file organization, etc.

                As part of my Computer Graphics courses, I implemented a CPU raytracer in C++ from scratch. The program reads in an input file of commands that sets up the scene data, then raytraces a scene based off of it. The code involves casting rays, anti-aliasing, detecting intersections with geometries in the scene, and calculating the new directions and lighting of rays along multiple bounces. Due to academic integrity policies, I am not permitted to publish the source code on GitHub, but you can click learn more to see a portfolio of images rendered by the raytracer.

                I wrote shaders that calculate Phong shading (diffuse, ambient, and specular) in GLSL, as well as a Mandelbrot fragment shader that renders the mandelbrot fractal on a sqaure. I also wrote a matrix stack program in C++ using OpenGL that uses a tree structure to organize scene objects and geometries, then calculates model-view and perspective matrices along a traversal of that tree.

                I joined UCSD's Human Powered Submarine club's electronic team. I impemented a sensor to measure and display the RPM of the sub's propellor using an arduino with a Hall effect sensor and a 3D-printed cuff containing magnets of alternating polarity. The hall effect sensor measures the magnetic strength of the magnet cuff as it's turning, and is able to detect each time a magnet passes by it. Using this, the arduino then calculates an RPM and sends that to an LCD screen which displays information on the sub's sensors. Because the Hall effect sensor needs a fast response time, I implemented a scheduler in the arduino that allows the RPM sensor to do a calculation using the whole CPU for a number of frames, then allows the other sensors to do their respective jobs for a number of frames, alternating. I also designed and 3D-printed a mount for the sensor using CAD.

                I made a python script in Blender to generate and export a JSON file with data about a 3D model's UV map.
                I parsed the data using a Processing 4 (java) script that generates an SVG image of the triangles in the UV map with each vertex labeled inside each triangle. I used that SVG file to laser cut the model out of plywood and assemble it for a sculpture project.

                Game development is what initially sparked my interest in computer science, and I've participated in many game jams (events where people create games/prototypes over a short period of time). Most of my games are from high school or earlier, but I more recently made a small game for the Ludum Dare 56 game jam in October 2024 with the theme "Tiny Creatures". It was made with Unity game engine, and programmed in C# over the course of a weekend.
