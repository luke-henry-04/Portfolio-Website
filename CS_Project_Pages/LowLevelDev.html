        <strong class="project_description">
            I started a low level development project in my spare time to better understand how software directly interacts with hardware. Using Intel's x86 Software 
            Developer's Manual (SDM) as a reference, I began by writing 
            16-bit real mode programs directly in the MBR partition on a hard drive.  
            Initial programs involved writing text to the screen from keyboard input 
            and coloring pixels in VGA graphics mode. They were written in x86 assembly and compiled to machine code in a hex editor using the SDM.
            <br><br>
            Building on what I learned about the boot process, BIOS interrupts, x86 hardware, and 16-bit segmented memory addressing, I developed a custom MBR bootloader in assembly. It loads a kernel file into memory from disk, sets up a Global Descriptor Table, and switches the processor into 32-bit protected mode before transferring control. 
            <br><br>
           To test the bootloader and gain experience with 32-bit assembly, I developed 32-bit programs, loaded and run from disk by the bootloader, that experiment with accessing a larger range of memory, performing keyboard and disk I/O through ports instead of BIOS interrupts, and basic kernel functionality like setting up an interrupt table. Current work is aimed at developing a minimal kernel that can run and schedule programs.
