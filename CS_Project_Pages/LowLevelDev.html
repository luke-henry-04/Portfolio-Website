        <strong class="project_description">
            I started a low level development project in my spare time to
            learn more about how computers function. Using Intel's x86 software 
            development manual (SDM) as a reference, the project began with writing 
            16-bit real mode programs directly in the MBR partition on a hard drive.  
            Initial programs involved writing text to the screen from keyboard input 
            and coloring the pixels in VGA graphics mode. They were written in assembly and compiled to machine code using the SDM as a reference.  
            <br><br>
            I then created a simple "bootloader" program that loads 
            larger files from the rest of the drive into memory and runs them. 
            Future plans for the project involve creating a proper bootloader 
            that also switches the CPU into protected mode and transfers control to an operating system. 
            I also intend to develop a simple operating system for the sake of better understanding scheduling, drivers, 
            memory paging, file organization, etc.
