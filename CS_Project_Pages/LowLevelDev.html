        <strong class="project_description">
            I started a low level development project in my spare time to better understand the interation between software and hardware. The project aims to use Intel's x86 Software Developer's Manual (SDM) as a primary reference for writing programs that can directly use the x86 architecture without taking any abstractions for granted.
            <br><br>
            I began by writing 16-bit real mode programs directly in the MBR partition on a hard drive. This gave me an understanding of the firmware's boot sequence and BIOS interrupts. 
            Initial programs involved writing text to the screen from keyboard input 
            and coloring pixels in VGA graphics mode. They were written in x86 assembly and compiled to machine code on paper using the SDM, then entered into a hex editor and written directly to a hard drive. 
            <br><br>
            Building on what I learned about BIOS interrupts and segmented memory addressing, I then developed a custom MBR bootloader in assembly. It loads a kernel file into memory from disk, sets up a Global Descriptor Table, and switches the processor into 32-bit protected mode before transferring control. 
            <br><br>
           To test the bootloader and gain experience with 32-bit assembly, I developed 32-bit programs, loaded and run from disk by the bootloader, that experiment with accessing a larger range of memory, performing keyboard and disk I/O through ports instead of BIOS interrupts, and basic kernel functionality like setting up an interrupt table. Current work is aimed at developing a minimal kernel that can run and schedule programs.
