        <strong class="project_description">
            I started a low level development project in my spare time to
            learn more about how computers function. Using Intel's x86 software 
            development manual (SDM) as a reference, the project began with writing 
            16-bit real mode programs directly in the MBR partition on a hard drive.  
            Initial programs involved writing text to the screen from keyboard input 
            and coloring the pixels in VGA graphics mode. 
            I then created a simple "bootloader" program that loads 
            larger files from the rest of the drive into memory and runs them. 
            Future plans for the project involve creating a proper bootloader 
            that also switches the CPU into protected mode and transfers control to an OS. 
            I also intend to develop a simple OS for the sake of understanding drivers, 
            memory paging, file organization, etc.
