            As part of my Computer Graphics courses, I implemented a CPU raytracer in C++ from scratch. The program reads in an input file of commands that sets up the scene data, then raytraces a scene based off of it. The code involves casting rays from the camera going through each pixel (at random positions within the pixel for anti-aliasing), detecting intersections with triangle and sphere geometries in the scene, and calculating the new directions and the diffuse/ambient/specular lighting of rays along multiple bounces. It currently uses directional and point lighting, with the additional option for soft shadows on point lights. Over the course of the class I will implement more features for faster and more realistic results. Due to academic integrity policies, I am not permitted to publish the source code on GitHub, but you can click learn more to see a portfolio of images rendered by the raytracer.
